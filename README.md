# Bootstrap Knowledge Check Project

This repository contains a webpage created using Bootstrap as outlined in the Coding Temple Module 1 **HTML and CSS**
Knowledge Check **Bootstrap Basics, Utilities, Forms, and Components** project.

The page contains samples of a number of Bootstrap components including:

* A responsive navigation bar which collapses with a hamburger menu on smaller screen sizes
* A Bootstrap form with fields for first and last names, email, and password, a checkbox to agree to terms and conditions, and a button to submit the user's information
* The email and password fields include utilities to make them required
* A styled table with alternating banded lines for improved readability
* A fluid image component to stretch a martini glass image across the page according to the device screen size
* A rounded image component
* 2 buttons, one of which is visible on all screen sizes and one which disappears altogether on smaller screens

Enjoy this small demonstration of the power of Bootstrap!
